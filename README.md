# Connect Client SDK Examples

**These examples have been rebranded to Worldline. As part of the rebranding the examples have moved to https://github.com/Worldline-Global-Collect/connect-sdk-client-js-example.**

---

This repository contains all SDK examples for the [Ingenico Connect JavaScript Client SDK](https://epayments.developer-ingenico.com/documentation/sdk/mobile/javascript/).
Refer to the README in each folder for more details about that specific example.

## Full vs. minimal

Full examples offer a fully working payment flow that mimics all the functionality that the hosted payment pages offer.
The minimal examples show you how to include the SDK with a module loader.
