# browserify Connect Client SDK Example

## What is it?

This example shows you how to load the [Ingenico Connect JavaScript Client SDK](https://github.com/Ingenico-ePayments/connect-sdk-client-js) with the browserify module loader.

The Connect SDK is used for all communication to the Connect API and crypto. See the [Ingenico ePayments Developer Hub](https://epayments.developer-ingenico.com/documentation/sdk/mobile/javascript/) for more information on how to use the Ingenico Connect API.
A complete copy of forge is included. which is used to do the actual crypto.

## How to install

Make sure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/); the LTS version is recommended. Run

    npm install

Get a copy of [forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/) and build it following the guide on GitHub. You have to use this build since forge is incompatible with module loaders at the moment.
Place the minified version in `dist/js`. A forge package is included in this example but you should update it to the latest version.

## How to start the payment process

Create a client session identifier and a customer identifier, which the Client API needs for authentication purposes.  
These can be obtained by your e-commerce server using the [Server SDKs](https://epayments.developer-ingenico.com/documentation/sdk/server/) or directly using the [Server API](https://epayments-api.developer-ingenico.com/s2sapi/v1/). Use this information along with the geographical region of the Client API you want to connect to and the payment details to start the process.  
If you incorporate this into your production process all this information should be used to initialize the payment process.

In `app.js` you include the sessiondetails, this is the only file that is browserify specific. See `create-payload.js` on how to set-up the actual payment request which is the same for all module loaders.

### Folder structure

```
+-- dist
|   +-- js
|       -- app.bundle.js - the example app bundled with browserify
|       -- create-payload.js - generic code which provides an example on how the SDK works, this is common for all minimal examples
|       -- forge.min.js - the encryption library; self packed since it's incompatible with webpack
+-- node_modules
|   ... folder containing all node dependencies; run npm install to get the dependencies
+-- src
|   +-- js
|       +-- app.js - the example app itself
|-- index.html - html page as start page
```
